2. Technical architecture decisions for engine integration
3. Critical browser compatibility issues (Google Earth multi-threading failure)
4. Enterprise-grade feature checklist
5. Testing strategy and coverage targets
6. Performance optimization priorities
7. Security and stability considerations

## 💡 SPECIFIC TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

### 1. Multi-Threading & Google Earth
```javascript
// Current BrowserView creation
const tab = new BrowserView({
  webPreferences: {
    nodeIntegration: false,
    contextIsolation: true,
    sandbox: true,
    webSecurity: true
  }
});
```

**Questions**:
- Missing headers for SharedArrayBuffer?
- Need to set `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`?
- Need to set `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`?
- Chromium flags to enable?
- Is this an upstream Electron bug?

### 2. Memory Optimization Architecture
```javascript
// Proposed Williams Integration
import { WilliamsSpaceOptimizer } from './memory-optimizer';

const optimizer = new WilliamsSpaceOptimizer();

function allocateTabMemory(estimatedPageSize) {
  const bound = optimizer.calculateSpaceBound(estimatedPageSize);
  // Apply memory budget to BrowserView?
  // How to enforce in Electron context?
}
```

**Questions**:
- Can we set memory limits per BrowserView?
- V8 heap size flags?
- Process-level isolation vs thread-level?
- How to detect when pages exceed budget?

### 3. Testing Architecture
```javascript
// Proposed Three-Regime Distribution
const testAllocation = {
  exploration: 30,  // New features (AI, Diaphanous, effects)
  optimization: 20, // Performance (memory, startup, rendering)
  stabilization: 50 // Core functions (tabs, navigation, bookmarks)
};
```

**Questions**:
- Is this distribution sensible for browser?
- Should we weight differently (e.g., more stabilization for core browser)?
- How do major browsers distribute test effort?

### 4. Error Ecosystem
```javascript
// Proposed Self-Healing Pattern
class BrowserErrorEcosystem {
  async handleTabCrash(tabId) {
    // 1. Log error with context
    // 2. Attempt recovery (reload?)
    // 3. If fails, escalate
    // 4. Learn from pattern (ML?)
  }
}
```

**Questions**:
- Best practices for Electron crash handling?
- When to reload vs abandon tab?
- User experience during recovery?
- How to prevent crash loops?

## 🎨 PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS

### On Code Reduction Philosophy
We've achieved 99.995% code reduction vs Chrome. But we use Chromium via BrowserView, so is this claim fair?

**Our Position**: 
- We write/maintain 10K lines vs Chrome's 30M
- Our complexity is 99.995% lower
- But we do rely on Chromium rendering engine
- Is this "standing on the shoulders of giants" or "cheating"?

**Questions for Grok**:
- How do we position this honestly?
- Is "99.995% less *browser chrome* code" more accurate?
- How did other browsers (Brave, Vivaldi, Edge) handle this messaging?

### On Asymmetrica Integration
Should we:
1. **Pursue full Asymmetrica Protocol integration** (mathematical consciousness, all engines)?
2. **Cherry-pick highest ROI engines** (Williams + Three-Regime only)?
3. **Stay minimal and ship** (D1.5 is good enough for 1.0)?

**Trade-offs**:
- Full integration: Differentiated but complex
- Cherry-pick: Pragmatic but incomplete vision
- Minimal: Fast launch but misses opportunity

**Questions for Grok**:
- What creates the most market value?
- What's the risk of over-engineering at this stage?
- Can we achieve "consciousness" in phases?
