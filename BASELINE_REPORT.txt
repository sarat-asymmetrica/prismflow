=== BASELINE STATE (BEFORE DOCTOR SUITE) ===

TypeScript Configuration:
  Status: NO_TYPESCRIPT_CONFIG
  tsconfig.json: NOT FOUND

=== DEPLOYMENT TRIANGLE STATUS (BASELINE) ===
TypeScript: N/A (Not configured)
Lint: N/A (Not configured)
Build: SUCCESS âœ“

=== OBSERVATIONS ===
1. This is a pure JavaScript Electron application
2. No TypeScript or ESLint configuration exists
3. Build system works correctly with electron-builder
4. The Doctor Suite will need to:
   - Install TypeScript configuration (ATD V3)
   - Install ESLint configuration (ALD V1)
   - Validate build improvements (ABD V1)

=== NEXT STEPS ===
1. Copy Doctor Suite from AsymmFlow
2. Run ATD V3 to add TypeScript support
3. Run ALD V1 to add linting support
4. Run ABD V1 to optimize build configuration
5. Re-measure all metrics
