## üîß ASSEMBLY STEPS

### Option 1: Manual Copy-Paste
1. Open **THE_VOID_FLOW_SOLUTION_PATHWAY_PAPER.html** in a text editor
2. Find `<!-- SECTION 3: METHODOLOGY -->` and `<div id="section-3"></div>`
3. Open **PAPER_SECTIONS_3_10.html**
4. Copy everything starting from `<!-- SECTION 3: METHODOLOGY -->` through the end of Section 6
5. Replace `<div id="section-3"></div>` through `<div id="section-6"></div>` in the main file
6. Repeat for Sections 7-10 using **PAPER_SECTIONS_7_10.html**

### Option 2: Automated (Python/Node.js)
```python
# Read main file
with open('THE_VOID_FLOW_SOLUTION_PATHWAY_PAPER.html', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    main_content = f.read()

# Read sections 3-6
with open('PAPER_SECTIONS_3_10.html', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    sections_3_6 = f.read()

# Read sections 7-10
with open('PAPER_SECTIONS_7_10.html', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    sections_7_10 = f.read()

# Replace placeholders
main_content = main_content.replace(
    '        <!-- SECTION 3: METHODOLOGY -->\n        <div id="section-3"></div>',
    sections_3_6.split('<!-- SECTION 3: METHODOLOGY -->')[1].split('<!-- SECTION 7:')[0].strip()
)

main_content = main_content.replace(
    '        <!-- SECTION 7: CONVERGENT VS DIVERGENT THINKING -->\n        <div id="section-7"></div>',
    sections_7_10.split('<!-- SECTION 7: CONVERGENT VS DIVERGENT THINKING -->')[1].strip()
)

# Write final file
with open('COMPLETE_VOID_FLOW_SOLUTION_PAPER.html', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(main_content)
```
