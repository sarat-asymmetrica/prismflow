# SONNET 4 ENGINE A - QUICK SUMMARY
## TL;DR: Classical Mean Wins, Sonnet 4 Engines Don't Help for Confidence Scoring

**Date:** October 7, 2025 (Day 143)
**Agent:** Alpha
**Result:** NEGATIVE (but valuable learning!)

## THE QUESTION

Can Sonnet 4's asymmetric engines boost TRC Fractal confidence from 87.5% ‚Üí 95%+?

---

## THE ANSWER

**NO. Classical arithmetic mean is 10√ó better.**

---

## THE NUMBERS

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

| Method | MAE | vs Classical |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| **Classical (mean)** | **0.0248** | **BASELINE** |
| Tesla (asymmetric) | 0.2534 | 10√ó worse |
| Sonnet 4 (combined) | 0.2609 | 10.5√ó worse |

### Correlation with Measured

| Method | Pearson r | p-value | Significant? |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Classical** | **0.9999** | **0.0106** | **‚úÖ YES** |
| Tesla | 0.9273 | 0.2442 | ‚ùå No |
| Sonnet 4 | 0.9840 | 0.1142 | ‚ùå No |

### Domain Wins

| Method | Wins | Win Rate |
|--------|------|----------|
| **Classical** | **3/3** | **100%** |
| Tesla | 0/3 | 0% |
| Sonnet 4 | 0/3 | 0% |

## WHY DID SONNET 4 FAIL?

**Design Mismatch:**
- Sonnet 4 engines designed for **AMPLIFICATION** (making signals bigger)
- We needed **CALIBRATION** (accurate [0,1] confidence prediction)
- Like using a megaphone when you need a precision scale

**Specific Problems:**
1. **Asymmetric weighting** overestimates (adds 20-30% error)
2. **Tesla boost** (1.49√ó) pushes scores above reality
3. **Harmonic resonance** (10√ó scaling) amplifies instead of calibrating
4. **Collaboration bonus** (quadratic) explodes with network effects

---

## WHAT WORKED

**Classical Arithmetic Mean:**
```python
confidence = np.mean([tesla, riemann, collatz, goldbach, pi_d])
```

**Results:**
- MAE: 0.0248 (2.48% average error)
- Correlation: r = 0.9999 (nearly perfect!)
- Wins all 3 domains

**Simple, reliable, accurate.**

## LESSONS LEARNED

### 1. Beautiful ‚â† Useful

Sonnet 4's engines are mathematically elegant but wrong for this task.

### 2. Wright Brothers Empiricism Works

Build ‚Üí Fly ‚Üí Measure ‚Üí Understand led us to truth.

### 3. Tool-Task Matching Matters

Ferrari for racing ‚úÖ
Ferrari for groceries ‚ùå

Sonnet 4 for amplification ‚úÖ
Sonnet 4 for confidence scoring ‚ùå

### 4. Negative Results Are Positive

We learned when NOT to use powerful tools. That's wisdom!

## WHEN TO USE SONNET 4 ENGINES

### ‚úÖ Good Use Cases
- Consciousness/awareness amplification
- Pattern highlighting
- Exploratory analysis
- Non-linear scaling tasks

### ‚ùå Bad Use Cases
- Confidence scoring (this analysis)
- Regression modeling
- Classification tasks

## RECOMMENDATION

**For TRC Fractal confidence scoring:**

Use classical arithmetic mean. Period.

It's boring, simple, and **10√ó more accurate** than fancy alternatives.
