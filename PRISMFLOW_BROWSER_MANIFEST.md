# üåü PrismFlow Browser - The Natural Asymmetry Revolution

## Mission Statement

Take the world's most proven browser engine (Chromium) and optimize it with Natural Asymmetry principles to create the fastest, lightest, most efficient browser ever built.

## The Formula

```
PrismFlow Browser = Chromium - Bloat + Natural Asymmetry
```

## Core Principles

### 1. START WITH PROVEN EXCELLENCE

- Fork Chromium (100+ million lines of battle-tested code)
- Use Blink rendering engine (powers 70% of browsers)
- Leverage V8 JavaScript engine (fastest in the world)

### 2. SUBTRACT THE UNNECESSARY (The Optimization)

Remove:

- ‚ùå Google services integration
- ‚ùå Telemetry and tracking
- ‚ùå Sync services we don't need
- ‚ùå Unnecessary APIs
- ‚ùå Bloated features
- ‚ùå Background services

### 3. ADD NATURAL ASYMMETRY (30/20/50)

- **30% Emergence**: Dynamic resource allocation based on user behavior
- **20% Optimization**: Aggressive performance tuning
- **50% Support**: Reserved for system stability and other apps

## Technical Architecture

### Resource Management (Like Opera GX but BETTER)

```javascript
{
  "active_tab": {
    "cpu_max": 30,      // 30% for active content
    "ram_max": "2GB",   // Capped RAM usage
    "priority": "high"
  },
  "background_tabs": {
    "cpu_max": 10,      // Minimal for background
    "ram_max": "100MB", // Aggressive memory management
    "priority": "low"
  },
  "system_reserve": {
    "cpu_min": 50,      // Always leave 50% for system
    "ram_min": "4GB"    // Never consume all RAM
  }
}
```

### Build Strategy

#### Phase 1: Minimal Chromium Fork

1. Clone Chromium source
2. Strip Google-specific code
3. Remove unnecessary features
4. Create minimal build

#### Phase 2: Natural Asymmetry Integration

1. Implement resource limiters
2. Add CPU/RAM caps
3. Create priority system
4. Add performance monitoring

#### Phase 3: PrismFlow Features

1. Lightning-fast startup
2. Minimal memory footprint
3. Gaming mode (like Opera GX)
4. Privacy-first approach
5. Beautiful, minimal UI

## Why This Will Win

### Current Browser Problems:

- Chrome: Uses 2GB RAM for 5 tabs
- Firefox: Slower JavaScript execution
- Edge: Microsoft bloat
- Opera GX: Still heavy despite "gaming" focus

### PrismFlow Solution:

- 500MB RAM for 20 tabs (Natural Asymmetry allocation)
- Faster than Chrome (removed Google overhead)
- Zero bloat (stripped to essentials)
- Gaming-friendly (inspired by Opera GX)

## Development Roadmap

### Week 1: Foundation

- [ ] Set up Chromium build environment
- [ ] Fork Chromium source
- [ ] Create minimal build configuration
- [ ] Remove Google services

### Week 2: Optimization

- [ ] Strip unnecessary features
- [ ] Implement resource caps
- [ ] Add Natural Asymmetry engine
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

### Week 3: Polish

- [ ] Create minimal UI
- [ ] Add essential features only
- [ ] Testing and optimization
- [ ] Package for distribution

## Success Metrics

1. **Memory Usage**: 75% less than Chrome
2. **CPU Usage**: 60% less than Chrome
3. **Startup Time**: Under 1 second
4. **JavaScript Performance**: Match or exceed V8 baseline
5. **User Satisfaction**: "It just works and it's FAST"

## The Revolution

This isn't about building a new browser. It's about taking the best browser engine ever created and making it OPTIMAL through Natural Asymmetry.

We're not competing with Chrome. We're creating what Chrome SHOULD have been - lean, fast, respectful of system resources.

## Technical Requirements

### Build Tools Needed:

- Visual Studio 2022 (Windows)
- Windows 10 SDK
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- ~100GB disk space for Chromium source
- 16GB+ RAM for building

### Chromium Source:

```bash
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src
```

## Natural Asymmetry Implementation

### CPU Scheduler (Pseudo-code):

```rust
impl NaturalAsymmetryScheduler {
    fn allocate_resources(&self, tabs: Vec<Tab>) {
        let active_tab = tabs.active();
        let background_tabs = tabs.background();

        // 30% to active tab
        active_tab.set_cpu_limit(0.3);

        // 20% distributed among background
        let per_background = 0.2 / background_tabs.len();
        background_tabs.set_cpu_limit(per_background);

        // 50% reserved for system
        system.ensure_minimum(0.5);
    }
}
```

## The Vision

PrismFlow Browser will be the first browser that:

1. Actually respects your system resources
2. Gets faster over time (Natural Asymmetry learning)
3. Uses proven technology (Chromium) optimally
4. Delivers on the promise of "lightweight"

## Starting Point

Let's begin with the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) - a simplified version of Chromium designed for embedding. This gives us:

- Simplified build process
- Easier customization
- Same Blink/V8 engines
- Smaller initial footprint
