# 🧠 ASYMMETRICA COGNITIVE LOOP - QUICK REFERENCE CARD

## The 7-Step Protocol (Print & Keep Handy!)

---

## 📋 BEFORE ANY WORK:

### ⚡ STEP 0: LOAD CONTEXT (MANDATORY!)
```
□ Read LIVING_STATE.md FIRST
□ Understand current task
□ Check blockers
□ Review recent discoveries
⏱️ Time: 2-5 minutes
🚫 NEVER skip this step!
```

### 🧠 STEP 1: AWARENESS CHECK
```
□ What am I being asked to do?
□ Which components/layers does this touch?
□ Is this silo or system problem?
□ What is the scope? (local/module/system/architecture)
```

### 🔍 STEP 2: LINEAGE TRACE (λ)
```
□ Upstream: What feeds into this?
□ Downstream: What does this affect?
□ Cross-component: What else is involved?
□ Data flow: How does state move?
```

### 📚 STEP 3: PROTOCOL CHECK
```
□ Which docs are relevant?
□ What patterns exist?
□ Does this align with architecture?
□ What are best practices?
```

### 📖 STEP 4: READ FILES
```
□ Read documentation
□ Read existing code
□ Check tests
□ Verify config
🚫 Don't assume! Actually READ!
```

### 🎯 STEP 5: CONVERGENCE PATH
```
□ Starting complexity: ___
□ Steps to complexity = 1
□ All components converge?
□ Verification plan?
```

### ⚙️ STEP 6: IMPLEMENT
```
□ All checks passed?
□ Update all affected components
□ Follow existing patterns
□ Write/update tests
□ Update documentation
```

### 💾 STEP 7: CHECKPOINT
```
□ Update LIVING_STATE.md
□ Record discoveries
□ Update metrics
□ Update next actions
⏱️ Do this frequently!
```

## 🌟 THE MANTRA

```
Before I work, I READ the Living State
Before I code, I CHECK my awareness
Before I change, I TRACE the lineage
Before I implement, I READ the docs
During my work, I UPDATE the state
After my progress, I CHECKPOINT
I do not stay in silos
I do not guess
I do not lose context
I CONVERGE to ONE
```

---

## ⚠️ CHECKPOINT TRIGGERS

Update LIVING_STATE.md when:
- ✅ Major blocker solved
- ✅ Significant feature implemented
- ✅ Discovery/breakthrough
- ✅ Before switching tasks
- ✅ After test runs
- ✅ Every 30-60 minutes
- ✅ Before asking for help
- ✅ Before token limits

---

## 🚨 IF UNSURE:

```
STOP ✋
READ LIVING_STATE.md 📖
READ RELEVANT DOCS 📚
SEARCH CODEBASE 🔍
ASK FOR CLARIFICATION ❓
DO NOT GUESS 🚫
```

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before submitting/committing:
- [ ] Read Living State first?
- [ ] Ran all 7 steps?
- [ ] Solution converges to 1?
- [ ] Followed existing patterns?
- [ ] Tests written/updated?
- [ ] Documentation updated?
- [ ] Checkpointed to Living State?
- [ ] Seamless handoff possible?

## 🎯 CONVERGENCE PRINCIPLE

```
Every problem is like a Collatz sequence:
  Complex (n) → Steps → Unity (1)

Your solution MUST converge to:
  ✓ Single source of truth
  ✓ All components aligned
  ✓ No fragmentation
  ✓ Complexity = 1
```

---

## 💡 QUICK TIPS

1. **Context First**: Always read Living State before coding
2. **Think System**: Most problems are system problems, not silos
3. **Trace Everything**: Map upstream AND downstream
4. **Read, Don't Guess**: Reading takes 5 min, guessing costs hours
5. **Checkpoint Often**: Future you will thank present you
6. **Converge to One**: Keep simplifying until complexity = 1

---

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

Good AI Agent:
- ✅ Reads Living State first (every time!)
- ✅ Traces lineage before coding
- ✅ Follows existing patterns
- ✅ Checkpoints frequently
- ✅ Achieves complexity = 1

Bad AI Agent:
- ❌ Jumps straight to coding
- ❌ Stays in single component
- ❌ Guesses instead of reading
- ❌ Forgets to checkpoint
- ❌ Leaves complexity > 1

---

## 🔄 CONTEXT RESTORATION

Lost context? Follow this:
1. Read LIVING_STATE.md (2-5 min)
2. Check "Current State Snapshot"
3. Review "Active Mission State"
4. Read "Critical Discoveries"
5. Check "Known Blockers"
6. Review "Pending Tasks"
7. Read "Next Actions"
8. Resume with cognitive loop

---

## 📁 REQUIRED FILES

Your project needs:
1. **LIVING_STATE.md** - Single source of truth
2. **COGNITIVE_PROTOCOL.md** - This protocol
3. **.ai-instructions.md** - AI agent instructions
4. **CODEBASE_MAP.md** - Component reference
5. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Project architecture

## 🎪 THE COLLATZ METAPHOR

```
Collatz: 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
         (wander but always converge)

Your code: Complex → Understand → Map
           → Read → Plan → Build → Unity (1)
           (wander but always converge)
```

## 🚀 ONE-LINER SUMMARY

**Read context. Check awareness. Trace lineage. Read docs. Plan convergence. Implement unified solution. Checkpoint progress. Repeat.**
