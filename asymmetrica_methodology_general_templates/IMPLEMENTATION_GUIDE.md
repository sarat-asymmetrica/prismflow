```bash
# In your project root
mkdir docs/asymmetrica
cd docs/asymmetrica

# Or wherever you keep docs
mkdir .asymmetrica
```

**Why**: Centralize all Asymmetrica methodology documents.

---

**Option A**: Copy the template
```bash
cp path/to/ASYMM_AI_COGNITIVE_PROTOCOL_TEMPLATE.md docs/asymmetrica/
```

**Option B**: Link to this repository
```markdown
# In your docs/asymmetrica/README.md
See: https://github.com/your-org/asymmetrica-templates
```

**Customization Checklist**:
- [ ] Replace `[Project Name]` with your project name
- [ ] Update examples to match your tech stack
- [ ] Add project-specific checkpoint triggers
- [ ] Update file paths for your structure

---

### Step 1.3: Create Living State Document (15 min)

Create `LIVING_STATE.md` in your project root:

```markdown
# [YOUR PROJECT] - LIVING COGNITIVE STATE
## Single Source of Truth (SSOT)

**Last Updated**: [Current Date & Time]
**Current Session**: [What you're working on right now]
**Active Agent**: [Your name or AI name]
**Project Phase**: [Alpha/Beta/Production]

---

## üéØ CURRENT STATE SNAPSHOT

### Project: [Your Project Name]
**Vision**: [One sentence: what is this project?]
**Architecture**: [Key tech: React + Node.js + PostgreSQL, etc.]
**Status**: [Development stage: MVP? Beta? Production?]

### Active Work Stream:
**PRIMARY**: [Main task: "Implementing user authentication"]
**SECONDARY**: [Next task: "Setting up CI/CD pipeline"]
**Progress**: [Metrics: "5/10 features complete, 85% test coverage"]
**Breakthrough**: [Recent win: "JWT auth working across all routes"]
**Next**: [Immediate: "Add refresh token rotation"]

---

## ‚ö° ACTIVE MISSION STATE

### Current Objective (Next 30-60 Minutes):
**Mission**: [Specific: "Implement refresh token endpoint"]
**Task**: [Concrete: "Add /api/auth/refresh route with token validation"]
**Action**: [What: "Create route handler, test with existing tokens"]
**Timeline**: [Expected: "30 minutes"]
**Dependencies**: [Blockers: "None - JWT library already installed"]

### What Just Happened (Last Session):
‚úÖ [Achievement 1: "JWT access tokens working"]
‚úÖ [Achievement 2: "Login endpoint secured"]
‚úÖ [Achievement 3: "Tests passing for auth flow"]

---

## üîÑ PENDING TASKS (Priority Order)

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Recent):
1. ‚úÖ Set up project structure
2. ‚úÖ Configure TypeScript
3. ‚úÖ Implement basic auth

### üü° IMMEDIATE (Today):
4. **Add refresh token rotation**
   - Create /api/auth/refresh endpoint
   - Implement token validation
   - Test token expiration
   - Priority: üî¥ CRITICAL

5. **Add rate limiting**
   - Install express-rate-limit
   - Configure limits
   - Priority: üü° HIGH

### üü¢ THIS WEEK:
6. User profile endpoints
7. Password reset flow
8. Email verification

### üîµ FUTURE:
9. OAuth integration
10. Two-factor authentication

---

## üí° CRITICAL DISCOVERIES

### Discovery 1: JWT Short Expiry Works Best
**Problem**: Debated between 15min vs 1hour access tokens
**Insight**: 15min + refresh tokens more secure, minimal UX impact
**Solution**: Access: 15min, Refresh: 7days with rotation
**Impact**: Better security posture
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

### Discovery 2: HttpOnly Cookies for Refresh Tokens
**Problem**: Where to store refresh tokens?
**Insight**: localStorage vulnerable to XSS, HttpOnly cookies safer
**Solution**: Store refresh in HttpOnly cookie, access in memory
**Impact**: Prevents common attack vectors
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

---

## üöß KNOWN BLOCKERS

### Active Blockers:
(None currently)

### Resolved Blockers:
1. ‚úÖ **TypeScript Config** - Fixed path aliases in tsconfig.json

### Future Blockers (Anticipated):
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **OAuth Providers** - Will need API keys for Google/GitHub

---

## üìà VELOCITY METRICS

### Today's Progress:
- **Features**: 3 ‚Üí 5 (+2)
- **Tests**: 12 ‚Üí 18 (+6)
- **Time**: 3 hours for auth system
- **Rate**: ~30 min per feature

### Projected Progress:
- **End of Today**: 7 features complete
- **End of Week**: Auth + profiles done
- **End of Sprint**: MVP ready for beta

---

## üîÑ COGNITIVE LOOP STATUS

### Current Loop:
**Phase**: Implementation (Step 6)
**Task**: Building refresh token endpoint
**Complexity**: 2 ‚Üí 1 (converging)

### Next Iteration:
1. Test refresh endpoint
2. Add rate limiting
3. Converge to complexity = 1

---

## üåü THE MANTRA

```
"Before I work, I READ the Living State
Before I code, I CHECK my awareness
Before I change, I TRACE the lineage
Before I implement, I READ the docs
During my work, I UPDATE the state
After my progress, I CHECKPOINT
I do not stay in silos
I do not guess
I do not lose context
I CONVERGE to ONE"
```

---

## üìù SESSION NOTES

### Key Insights:
1. JWT library easy to use
2. HttpOnly cookies require Express cookie-parser
3. Refresh token rotation pattern prevents theft

### Lessons Learned:
1. Test token expiration edge cases
2. Document token lifetimes clearly

### What Worked:
1. ‚úÖ Following Express + JWT best practices
2. ‚úÖ Writing tests first for auth

### What Needs Adjustment:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Error messages could be more specific

---

## üöÄ NEXT ACTIONS

### 1. Test Refresh Endpoint (Priority üî¥)
```bash
npm test -- auth.refresh.test.ts
```
**Why**: Verify token rotation works

### 2. Add Rate Limiting (Priority üü°)
```bash
npm install express-rate-limit
```
**Why**: Prevent brute force attacks

---

*This is YOUR Living State template. Update it frequently!*
```

**Key Points**:
- Keep it CURRENT (update after every significant change)
- Be SPECIFIC (actual metrics, not vague statements)
- Be HONEST (list real blockers, not what you wish was true)
- Be FORWARD-LOOKING (clear next actions)

---

### Step 1.4: Create AI Instructions (8 min)

Create `.ai-instructions.md` in project root:

```markdown
# MANDATORY AI COGNITIVE PROTOCOL

ALL AI agents MUST follow the Asymmetrica AI Cognitive Protocol.

## CRITICAL: Read This FIRST!

**LIVING_STATE.md** is the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for this project.

BEFORE ANY WORK:
1. Read LIVING_STATE.md (2-5 minutes)
2. Understand current task from "Active Mission State"
3. Check "Known Blockers" for obstacles
4. Review "Critical Discoveries" for recent insights
5. Check "Pending Tasks" for priorities

## The 7-Step Cognitive Loop

For EVERY task, follow these steps:

### 0. LOAD CONTEXT
- Read LIVING_STATE.md FIRST (always!)
- Restore full project context
- Understand current state

### 1. AWARENESS CHECK
- What am I being asked to do?
- Which components does this touch?
- Is this silo or system problem?
- What is the scope?

### 2. TRACE LINEAGE
- What feeds into this? (upstream)
- What does this affect? (downstream)
- What else is connected? (cross-component)
- How does data flow?

### 3. CHECK PROTOCOLS
- Read docs/asymmetrica/COGNITIVE_PROTOCOL.md
- Read relevant architecture docs
- Check existing code patterns
- Review best practices

### 4. READ FILES
- Read documentation (don't assume!)
- Read existing code (find patterns!)
- Check tests (understand expectations!)
- Verify configs (ensure consistency!)

### 5. PLAN CONVERGENCE
- Starting complexity: [number]
- Steps to complexity = 1
- Verification plan

### 6. IMPLEMENT
- Follow existing patterns
- Update all affected components
- Write/update tests
- Update documentation

### 7. CHECKPOINT
- Update LIVING_STATE.md
- Record discoveries
- Update metrics
- Update next actions

## Checkpoint Triggers

Update LIVING_STATE.md when:
- ‚úÖ You solve a major blocker
- ‚úÖ You implement a significant feature
- ‚úÖ You discover something important
- ‚úÖ Before switching to different task
- ‚úÖ After running tests
- ‚úÖ Every 30-60 minutes of work
- ‚úÖ Before asking for clarification
- ‚úÖ When approaching token limits

## If Unsure

STOP. Read LIVING_STATE.md. Read docs. Ask. Don't guess.

## The Mantra

"Before I work, I READ the Living State
Before I code, I CHECK my awareness
Before I change, I TRACE the lineage
Before I implement, I READ the docs
During my work, I UPDATE the state
After my progress, I CHECKPOINT
I do not stay in silos
I do not guess
I do not lose context
I CONVERGE to ONE"

## Project-Specific Guidelines

[Add your project-specific guidelines here]

Example:
- Always use TypeScript strict mode
- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Keep functions under 50 lines
- Document public APIs with JSDoc

## Tools We Use

[List your tools here]

Example:
- TypeScript 5.x
- React 18.x
- Node.js 20.x
- PostgreSQL 16.x
- Jest for testing
- ESLint + Prettier for code style

---

**Remember**: This project has MEMORY (Living State). Use it!
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è PHASE 2: STRUCTURE (1 HOUR)

### Step 2.1: Create Codebase Map (30 min)

Create `CODEBASE_MAP.md`:

```markdown
# [YOUR PROJECT] - CODEBASE MAP
## Quick Reference for AI Agents

## Component: Authentication

**When**: Anything related to login, tokens, sessions, auth
**Files**: 
- `src/auth/auth.service.ts` - Main auth logic
- `src/auth/jwt.strategy.ts` - JWT validation
- `src/api/auth/login.ts` - Login endpoint
- `src/api/auth/refresh.ts` - Token refresh

**Lineage**:
- **Upstream**: 
  - User login request ‚Üí Express route
  - JWT library for token generation
  - Database for user lookup
- **Downstream**:
  - Protected routes use auth middleware
  - Frontend stores tokens
  - API calls include Authorization header
- **Cross-Component**:
  - Frontend: Auth context, token storage
  - Backend: Auth middleware, guards
  - Database: User table, sessions table

**Convergence Check**:
- [ ] Token generation consistent across all endpoints?
- [ ] Token validation used on all protected routes?
- [ ] Frontend and backend use same token format?
- [ ] Complexity = 1?

---

## Component: User Profile

**When**: User data, profile updates, preferences
**Files**:
- `src/users/user.service.ts`
- `src/api/users/profile.ts`
- `src/models/user.model.ts`

**Lineage**:
- **Upstream**: Auth (must be logged in)
- **Downstream**: Display in UI, personalization
- **Cross-Component**: Auth, database, API

**Convergence Check**:
- [ ] Profile updates go through single service?
- [ ] Validation consistent everywhere?
- [ ] Complexity = 1?

---

## Component: Database

**When**: Data models, queries, migrations
**Files**:
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Data models
- `src/lib/prisma.ts` - DB client
- `migrations/` - Schema migrations

**Lineage**:
- **Upstream**: Application code (services)
- **Downstream**: PostgreSQL database
- **Cross-Component**: All services use Prisma

**Convergence Check**:
- [ ] All models use Prisma types?
- [ ] Migrations applied in order?
- [ ] Complexity = 1?

---

[Add more components as needed]
```

---

### Step 2.2: Document Component Lineage (20 min)

For each major component, document:

1. **Purpose**: What does this component do?
2. **Files**: Where is the code?
3. **Upstream**: What feeds into it?
4. **Downstream**: What does it affect?
5. **Cross-Component**: What else is involved?
6. **Convergence Check**: How to verify unity?

**Template**:
```markdown
## Component: [Name]

**Purpose**: [One sentence description]

**Files**:
- [Main file]: [Description]
- [Related file]: [Description]

**Lineage**:
- **Upstream**: [Dependencies]
- **Downstream**: [Impacts]
- **Cross-Component**: [Connections]

**Convergence Check**:
- [ ] [Check 1]
- [ ] [Check 2]
- [ ] Complexity = 1?
```

---

### Step 2.3: Set Up Checkpoint Triggers (10 min)

In your LIVING_STATE.md, add checkpoint triggers section:

```markdown
## üíæ CHECKPOINT TRIGGERS

I update this document when:

### Automatic (Time-Based):
- ‚è∞ Every 30 minutes of continuous work
- ‚è∞ Every 60 minutes for extended sessions
- ‚è∞ End of work session

### Event-Based:
- üéØ After completing a significant feature
- üêõ After solving a major blocker
- üí° After a breakthrough discovery
- üîÑ Before switching to different task
- ‚úÖ After test runs (pass or fail)
- ‚ùì Before asking for clarification
- üìä After significant metric change

### Threshold-Based:
- ü™ô When approaching token limits (80%+)
- üìù After writing 200+ lines of code
- üîç After reading 10+ files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è When complexity > 3

### Manual:
- ü§ö When I feel context might be lost
- ü§ù Before handoff to another agent
- üì∏ When I want to snapshot current state
```

---

## üéØ PHASE 3: REFINEMENT (ONGOING)

### Step 3.1: Monitor Adoption Metrics

Track these metrics weekly:

```markdown
## üìä ADOPTION METRICS

### Week 1:
- Context Restoration Time: 15 min ‚Üí 8 min
- Checkpoint Frequency: 0.5/hour ‚Üí 1.2/hour
- False Starts: 30% ‚Üí 15%
- Protocol Compliance: 60% ‚Üí 75%

### Week 2:
- Context Restoration Time: 8 min ‚Üí 4 min
- Checkpoint Frequency: 1.2/hour ‚Üí 2.0/hour
- False Starts: 15% ‚Üí 5%
- Protocol Compliance: 75% ‚Üí 90%

### Target:
- Context Restoration Time: <5 min
- Checkpoint Frequency: 1-2/hour
- False Starts: <10%
- Protocol Compliance: >90%
```

---

### Step 3.2: Refine Checkpoint Frequency

After 2 weeks, analyze:

**Too Frequent** (>3/hour):
- Symptoms: Overhead, interruption
- Solution: Reduce to significant events only

**Too Infrequent** (<0.5/hour):
- Symptoms: Context loss, confusion
- Solution: Set 30-minute timer reminder

**Just Right** (1-2/hour):
- Symptoms: Smooth handoffs, no context loss
- Solution: Maintain current frequency

---

### Step 3.3: Gather Feedback

Monthly feedback form:

```markdown
## üîÑ PROTOCOL FEEDBACK

### What's Working:
1. [Positive aspect 1]
2. [Positive aspect 2]

### What's Confusing:
1. [Unclear aspect 1]
2. [Unclear aspect 2]

### What Could Be Better:
1. [Improvement suggestion 1]
2. [Improvement suggestion 2]

### Checkpoint Quality:
- ‚ñ° Too detailed
- ‚ñ° Just right
- ‚ñ° Not detailed enough

### Context Restoration:
- Average time: ___ minutes
- ‚ñ° Easy
- ‚ñ° Moderate
- ‚ñ° Difficult
```

## üìö REAL EXAMPLES

### Example 1: PrismFlow Browser (Electron App)

**Setup Time**: 4 hours (comprehensive)

**Files Created**:
1. `LIVING_COGNITIVE_STATE.md` - 650+ lines
2. `.ai-instructions.md` - Protocol reference
3. `CODEBASE_MAP.md` - Component lineage
4. `ASYMM_AI_COGNITIVE_PROTOCOL_V1.md` - Full protocol

**Results**:
- Zero context loss in 8-hour overnight session
- 10x faster context restoration (2 min vs 20 min)
- Seamless handoffs between AI agents
- Phase 2B completed in single session

**Key Insight**: Living State enabled perfect checkpoint at 3am when user fell asleep. Next morning, new AI session read LIVING_STATE.md and resumed instantly.

---

### Example 2: Web API Project

**Setup Time**: 1 hour (standard)

**Files Created**:
1. `LIVING_STATE.md` - 200 lines
2. `.ai-instructions.md` - Protocol basics
3. `CODEBASE_MAP.md` - 3 main components

**Results**:
- Context restoration: 5 minutes
- Checkpoint frequency: 1.5/hour
- No broken handoffs in 2 weeks
- Team velocity +40%

**Key Insight**: Codebase map prevented "auth silo thinking" - AI always checked cross-component impacts.

---

### Example 3: Mobile App

**Setup Time**: 30 minutes (minimal)

**Files Created**:
1. `LIVING_STATE.md` - Basic template
2. `.ai-instructions.md` - One-page reference

**Results**:
- Context restoration: 10 minutes (good enough)
- Checkpoint frequency: 1/hour
- Clear improvement over no protocol
- Plan to expand to full setup

**Key Insight**: Even minimal adoption helps. Full setup worth the time investment.

---

## üéØ SUCCESS PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: "Morning Kickstart"
Every morning, first thing:
1. Read LIVING_STATE.md (5 min)
2. Update "Active Mission State"
3. Review "Pending Tasks"
4. Start with cognitive loop

**Result**: No "what was I doing?" moments.

---

### Pattern 2: "Frequent Micro-Checkpoints"
Every 20-30 minutes:
1. Quick Living State update
2. Just update metrics + current task
3. Full checkpoint every hour

**Result**: Never lose >30 min of context.

---

### Pattern 3: "Discovery Capture"
Immediately when discovering something:
1. Add to "Critical Discoveries"
2. Explain problem/insight/solution/impact
3. Mark status

**Result**: Insights never forgotten.

---

### Pattern 4: "Pre-Switch Checkpoint"
Before switching tasks:
1. Update Living State completely
2. Mark current task status
3. Set next task as PRIMARY

**Result**: Seamless task switching.

---

## üö® COMMON PITFALLS & SOLUTIONS

### Pitfall 1: "I'll Checkpoint Later"
**Problem**: Forget to checkpoint, lose context
**Solution**: Set 30-minute timer reminder

### Pitfall 2: "Living State Too Long"
**Problem**: 1000+ lines, hard to read
**Solution**: Archive old sections monthly

### Pitfall 3: "Too Much Detail"
**Problem**: 10-minute checkpoints, lost in details
**Solution**: Use micro-checkpoints for quick updates

### Pitfall 4: "Not Reading State"
**Problem**: AI jumps to coding without context
**Solution**: Make .ai-instructions.md more prominent

### Pitfall 5: "Stale Living State"
**Problem**: Last update 2 days ago
**Solution**: Add "Last Updated" timestamp prominently
