npm warn exec The following package was not found and will be installed: eslint@9.37.0

Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 9.37.0

ESLint couldn't find an eslint.config.(js|mjs|cjs) file.

From ESLint v9.0.0, the default configuration file is now eslint.config.js.
If you are using a .eslintrc.* file, please follow the migration guide
to update your configuration file to the new format:

https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide

If you still have problems after following the migration guide, please stop by
